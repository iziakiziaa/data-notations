    <h1 class="center">Information Technology</h1>
    <p class="lead">Information technology (IT) is the study or use of computers, telecommunication systems and other devices to create, process, store, retrieve and transmit information.[1] While the term is commonly used to refer to computers and computer networks, it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450 – 1840), electromechanical (1840 – 1940), and electronic (1940 to present).

            <h2>Data processing</h2>
            <p>Electronic data processing or business information processing can refer to the use of automated methods to process commercial data. Typically, this uses relatively simple, repetitive activities to process large volumes of similar information. For example: stock updates applied to an inventory, banking transactions applied to account and customer master files, booking and ticketing transactions to an airline's reservation system, billing for utility services.

            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p>Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.
